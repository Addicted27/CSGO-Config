# CSGO Autoexec by Cryochase
There's my CS GO autoexe.cfg 
Most of it is translated to Polish Language, I probably will make it in English also. 

Autoexec include: 

Weapon buying binds: Numeric Keyboard. 


Fast Switch Bind: is binded under "V". 


net_graph 0/1 while we're using score table. 


No animation while crouching. 

Slower movement of weapon in hand, slower movement of scope. 

Audio bind: rise up volume with arrow on your keyboard, get it quiet with down arrow on your keyboard.

Ignoring radio messages: left arrow on your keyboard. 

Ignoring opponent messages: right arrow on your keyboard.
